# Artificial Intelligence 

Jos√© Daniel Casado Aguilar - 0940167

Simple 2D shooter game with AI with different behaviours.

## Behaviours

**Seek and Flee**: This enemies *seek* the player when it faces away from them and *flee* from the player when it faces towards them. They turn *red* and *blue* respectively.
**Pursue and Evade**: The enemy will *pursue* the player and *evade* its bullets. When it's pursuing it turns *white*, when it's evading it turns *purple*.
**Wander and Idle**: The enemy will change between two modes: random *wandering* and not moving. When it's wandering it turns *grey* and when it's idle it turns *black*.
**Approach and Shoot**: The enemy will approach the enemy (with a slowdown when it's at a certain distance) and turn *green*. When it's close enough it will stop, fire a bullet toward the player and turn yellow.

There are videos showing each of the behaivours individually and the complete game.

## Build instructions

Open `j_casadoaguilar_AI_P1.sln` with Visual Studio. Select `Release` and `x64` and then `Build Solution` (Ctrl + Shift + B)

## Run instructions

Within Visual Studio, click on `Local Windows Debugger` (F5)

### Use instructions

The player will start at the center of the screen.
An enemy will spawn randomly every 6 seconds.
To steer the player, press the A and D keys. To move it, press the W or D keys.

## Scene file

The file `GDP2019_20/assets/scene1.json` defines the scene that the program will load in a JSON file.

The format of the file is the following:

```json
{
    "Sounds": 
    [
        // this will create a channel group per object
        {
            "name": "zombie sounds",
            // initial position of the sounds
            "position": [20.0, 0.0, 15.0],
            // the audios will loop automatically
            "audios": [
                // filepath of each of the sounds
                // all of them will be streamed
